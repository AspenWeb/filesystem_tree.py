Tutorial
========

Instantiate the :py:class:`~filesystem_tree.FilesystemTree` class:

>>> from filesystem_tree import FilesystemTree
>>> ft = FilesystemTree()

Now make files!

>>> ft.mk(('greetings/program.txt', 'Greetings, program!'))

You can get the full absolute path of the file you created with
:py:func:`~filesystem_tree.FilesystemTree.resolve`:

>>> filepath = ft.resolve('greetings/program.txt')

Make directories like so:

>>> ft.mk('my/directory/')

When you're done, clean up with :py:func:`~filesystem_tree.FilesystemTree.remove`:

>>> ft.remove()

Or use it as a context manager to clean up automatically:

>>> with FilesystemTree() as ft:
...     ft.mk('my/stuff')

    Create a new instance of this class every time you need an isolated

    You can use it as a context manager to automatically :py:func:`remove` the

    ...     pass

    However, the tree is only removed if the code block doesn't raise an
    exception. If there's an exception the tree will be left on the filesystem
    so you can debug.

            treedef contains a tuple that doesn't have two or three items

        :returns: ``None``

        This method iterates over the items in ``treedef``, creating
        directories for any strings, and files for any tuples. For file tuples,
        the first item is the path of the file, the second is the contents to
        write, the third (optional) item is whether to dedent the contents
        first before writing it, and the fourth (optional) item is the encoding
        to use when writing the file. All paths must be specified using ``/``
        as the separator (they will be automatically converted to the native
        path separator for the current platform). Any intermediate directories
        will be created as necessary.

        So for example if you instantiate a :py:class:`FilesystemTree`:

        >>> ft = FilesystemTree()

        And you call :py:func:`mk` with:

        >>> ft.mk(('path/to/file.txt', 'Greetings, program!'))

        Then you'll have one file in your tree:

        >>> files = os.listdir(os.path.join(ft.root, 'path', 'to'))
        >>> print(' '.join(files))
        file.txt

        And it will have the content you asked for:

        >>> open(ft.resolve('path/to/file.txt')).read()
        'Greetings, program!'

        The automatic dedenting is so you can use multi-line strings in indented
        code blocks to specify file contents and indent it with the rest of your
        code, but not have the indents actually written to the file. For example:

        >>> def foo():
        ...     ft.mk(('other/file.txt', '''
        ...     Here is a list of things:
        ...         - Thing one.
        ...         - Thing two.
        ...         - Thing three.
        ...     '''))
        ...
        >>> foo()
        >>> print(open(ft.resolve('other/file.txt')).read())
        <BLANKLINE>
        Here is a list of things:
            - Thing one.
            - Thing two.
